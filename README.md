Hello readers, this is the pipeline for my report. Not sure if EDA is working atm as I was trying to fix an merge bug. Running feature engineering should substitute fine.

Logic remains, I used python instead of R due to entrenched bias. And strong familiarity with sklearn, pytorch, cuda kernelling.

Python 3.11 

and

Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools.

See Requirements.txt for libraries.

Folder Structure for replication should be

-> Folder working directory

  -> Pipeline
  
    -> Code
    
      -> **Scripts**
      
    ->Data
    
      -> only required is 01_raw (with BBC.zip)
