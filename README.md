*Important to read in code layout*

Hello , this is the pipeline for feature analysis and model evaluation, using Big Bash Leage (T-20 cricket data to predict Player of the Match (PotM). 
Not sure if EDA is working at the moment as I was trying to fix an merge bug. 

Running feature engineering -> model should work fine.

I used python instead of R due to entrenched bias. And strong familiarity with sklearn, pytorch, cudf/polars/pandas/mysql.

Main Version:
Python 3.11 and Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools.

See Requirements.txt for libraries.

Folder Structure for replication should be

-> Folder working directory
  -> Pipeline
    -> Code
      -> **Scripts**
    -> Data
      -> only required is 01_raw (with BBC.zip)
